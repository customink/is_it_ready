# CircleCI Snippets
#
# Reusable snippets are defined below this section. These are yaml fragments that can injected into the standard
# CircleCI configuration, reducing the complexity of the entire block.

# CircleCI Commands Configuration
#
# Commands are re-usable steps that can be shared across jobs. For example the installation of gems using bundler or
# waiting on a database connection. By defining them inside the commands section, they can be invoked as any standard
# command on the system, but will already be preconfigured. This allows us to keep the jobs definition small and clean

# CircleCI Job Configuration
#
# This section defines all the available jobs that can be executed inside a Workflow.
# Think of a Job as a batch of tasks that need to be performed to setup the environment and perform a specific task
# such as running RSpec, uploading the test results to CodeClimate etc.

# CircleCI Workflow Execution Order
#
# Here we define the Workflow, the order of the various jobs and their dependencies.
# This allows us to decide whether to run certain tasks sequentially or run several of them in parallel.
